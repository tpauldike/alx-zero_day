My first readme
This work is about my journey through the ALX Software Engineering Course, a life changing journey indeed
As a beginner, I am yet to grasp several concepts which I believe are fundamental but please, regard this piece or write up here as a README file
It feels like I know what the future holds for me. This project right here is part of my life history, my earliest work as a Software Engineer in the making.
